# Notes application with 95% built by copilot.

In testing out copilot, this is what we created for a very basic notes app that can do CRUD operations for a note.

It's not the prettiest code, but this was done within 45 minutes. I had to learn how to prompt copilot into giving me what I needed...which took longer than I expected.

I definitely would not have taken this approach for how to develop this if I were thinking about doing this on a production server. There's no model/view/controller at all and it seems quite a bite of code has been duplicated.

My next task is to learn how to have copilot refactor some of this code...if that's possible.
